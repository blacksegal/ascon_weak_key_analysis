## For verification of distinguishers and dimension of weak keys as given in Section 4 and Section 5 of our paper.

-- C code for distinguishers is included in the "distinguishers" folder.

-- Python code "weak_keys_small.py" gives the estimated and actual weak keys count for small parameters. Also,
   it calculates the coefficients of Equations 20 and 22. To run type "python3 weak_keys_small.py" on terminal
   with Python 3 installed.

-- Sage code "weak_key_small_parameter.sage" gives the estimated and actual weak keys count for small parameters.
   To run type "sage weak_key_small_parameter.sage" on terminal.
